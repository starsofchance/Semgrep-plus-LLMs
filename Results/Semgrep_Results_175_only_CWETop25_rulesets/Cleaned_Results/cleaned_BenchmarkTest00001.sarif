To prevent this vulnerability, validate and sanitize any input that is used to create references to file paths. Also, enforce strict file access controls. For example, choose privileges allowing public-facing applications to access only the required files. In Java, you may also consider using a utility method such as `org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils.getName(...)` to only retrieve the file name from the path."
