To prevent this vulnerability start by identifying if the framework or library leveraged has built-in features or offers plugins for CSRF protection. CSRF tokens should be unique and securely random. The `Synchronizer Token` or `Double Submit Cookie` patterns with defense-in- depth mechanisms such as the `sameSite` cookie flag can help prevent CSRF.
