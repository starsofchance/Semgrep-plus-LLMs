This includes filenames supplied by user uploads or downloads.\nIf possible, consider hashing user input or replacing it with unique values and\nuse `Path.resolve` to resolve and validate the path information\nprior to processing any file functionality.\n\nExample using `Path.resolve` and not allowing direct user input:\n```\n// Class to store our user data along with a randomly generated file name\npublic static class UserData {\n    private String userFileNameUnsafe;\n    private String fileName;\n    public UserData(String userFileName) {\n        this.userFileNameUnsafe = userFileName;\n        // Generate a random ID for the filename\n        this.fileName = UUID.randomUUID().toString();\n    }\n    public String getUserFileNameUnsafe() { return userFileNameUnsafe; };\n    public String getFileName() { return fileName; };\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n    // User input, saved only as a reference\n    UserData userData = new UserData(\"..\\\\test.txt\");\n    // Restrict all file processing to this directory only\n    String base = \"/var/app/restricted\";\n    Path basePath = Paths.get(base);\n    // Resolve the full path, but only use our random generated filename\n    Path fullPath = basePath.resolve(userData.getFileName());\n    // verify the path is contained within our basePath\n    if (!fullPath.startsWith(base)) {\n        throw new Exception(\"Invalid path specified!\");\n    }\n    // process / work with file\n}\n```\n\nFor more information on path traversal issues see OWASP:\nhttps://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal\n"
