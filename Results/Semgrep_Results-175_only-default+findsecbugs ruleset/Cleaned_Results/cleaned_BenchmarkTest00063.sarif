The `Synchronizer Token` or `Double Submit Cookie` patterns with defense-in- depth mechanisms such as the `sameSite` cookie flag can help prevent CSRF.

To prevent this vulnerability, validate and sanitize any input that is used to create references to file paths. Also, enforce strict file access controls. For example, choose privileges allowing public-facing applications to access only the required files. In Java, you may also consider using a utility method such as `org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils.getName(...)` to only retrieve the file name from the path.\n\n<b>References:</b>\n - [Semgrep Rule](https://semgrep.dev/r/java.servlets.security.httpservlet-path-traversal.httpservlet-path-traversal)\n - [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Path_Traversal](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Path_Traversal)\n",

An attacker can manipulate the file path which the application uses to access files. If the application does not validate user input and sanitize file paths, sensitive files such as configuration or user data can be accessed, potentially creating or overwriting files.
